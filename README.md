# ILoveZappos
Android app for Zappos

Built an app that takes input from the user as a search query and returns the first item (there could be more than one) and display it as a product page.
The app has a floating action button on the screen that adds items to a cart. Used databinding for the product page you create.

Built apk is available in output/ folder.
